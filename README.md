# Turning Timing Differences into Data Leakage
This is a hands-on training session by Daniel Weber and Michael Schwarz given for the  International Winter School on Microarchitectural Security 2022 (Mic-Sec '22)

## Overview
In this repository you can find the three exercises (together with their solutions) and the presentation slides.

## Requirements
### CPU
We require an x86 CPU.
The exercises were tested on a modern Intel CPU. While they should also work for most non-Intel CPUs, we did not explicitly tested this.

### Operating System
We assume a native Linux installation.
While the exercises may still work when executed in a VMs or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) the results are likely instable.


## Noise Reduction
Microarchitecutral experiments are by their nature prone to noise on the system.
Hence, the following steps can be taken to ensure that the exercises work more stable:
- If you are working on an Laptop, connect it to power.
- Stop all unneccessary programs running on the system. Especially music or video streaming.
